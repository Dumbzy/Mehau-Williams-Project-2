				<p>Being one of the most important features of the ALTAR AR application, the Reward System incentivizes users to become the best they can be. Rewards can be acquired through various means whether from external missions created from other users or personal missions/milestones you have set for yourself otherwise known as Daily Missions.</p>

	<section id="pages-contents">
			<div class="page-text">
				<p>The Daily Missions feature is relative to each user and the missions are determined by the user themselves. The Player Statistics feature is able to work in tandem with this, where the user can request to improve in various traits and the Daily Missions will adjust according to those requests. And in an RPG fashion UI elements will be displayed on the interface to remind users their current mission.</p>
